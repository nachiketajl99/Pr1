--Clauses/filters 
--We have Clauses in Sql to perform filter related information
--1.Where
--2.order by
--3.group by
--4.having 

select * from FirstTable

--1.Where
--Where clause is used with comparison operator,arithmatic and logical operators.
--It used to filter the specific condition or we can select a particlar records from table.

--Operators
--1.Comaprision Operator 
--2.Logical Operator
--3.Arithmatic operator
--4.IN and NOT IN
--5.Between and NOT BETWEEN
--6.LIKE

--1.Comaprision Operator 
--it is used to compare the condition provided in filter clauses or where clause.
-- = - equal to
-- > - greater than
-- < - less than
-- >= - greater than equal to
-- <= - less than equal to
-- != or <> -not equal to



select * from employee where dept = 'HR'
select * from employee where EID > 5
select * from employee where EID < 4
select * from employee where EID >= 7
select * from employee where EID <= 4
select * from employee where EID <> 7  --not equal to
select * from employee where EID != 7  --not equal to



--Logical Operator 

--these operators are used to compare two inputs logically and provide the result.
--1.AND
--It will be just like multiplication 

--AND oeartion
--A		B		O/P
--0		0		0
--0		1		0
--1		0		0
--1		1		1

--A			B			O/P
--False		False		False
--False		True		False
--True		False		False
--True		True		True

select * from employee where eid = 1 and dept = 'Finance'
select * from employee where EID =5 and loc ='Patna'




--2.OR
--It will work like addition
--OR operation
--A		B		O/P
--0		0		0
--0		1		1
--1		0		1
--1		1		1

--A		B		O/P
--False		False		False
--False		True		True

--True		True		True

select * from employee where eid = 11 or dept = 'Finance'
select * from employee 

select * from employee where EID =5 or salary > 40000 or loc ='Pune'

---------------------------------------------------------

--IN and NOT IN operator 

--This operator will allow you to navigate or point out the values which maintained or mentioned inside the in clause.
--Not In operator will perform vice-versa operation as compared to IN operator.

select * from employee where eid => 1,2 -- incorrect syntax because comparison operator will allow you to insert only one condition.

select * from employee where eid in (1,3,4,5)
select * from employee where eid not in (1,3,4,5)

select * from employee where loc in ('Pune','sangali','Miraj')
select * from employee where loc not in ('Pune','sangali','Miraj')


------------------------------------------
--Between and Not between

--This operator/ clause is used to display the values or records between the range you have specified.
--This operator works along with AND operator.

select * from employee where EID between 2 and 6

select * from employee where Loc between 'A' and 'N'   --A to N

--Not Between
select * from employee where EID not between 2 and 6

select * from employee where Loc not between 'A' and 'N'  -- excluding A to N cities name  <=N 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--LIKE 
--LIKE operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column.
--Mostly like operator is used in where clause.
--Like operator used wildcards for searching a pattern
--1. % - Represents zero,one or multiple charecters or numbers./ A substitute for Zero or more characters

--ex:  Seeta,meeta,geeta sena, sona siya 

--'S%' - start with 'S' chareter and it will display all the names which starts with S.
--'%S' - End with 'S' charetcer and it will display all the names which END with S.
--'%S%' -Anywhere inside record/column if 'S' charetcer and it will display all the names which starts or ends or anywhere inside into a column.

select * from employee where FirstName like 's%' ---at the start of name s

select * from employee where FirstName like '%A' -- at the end of name a

select * from employee where FirstName like '%A%' --anywhere inside or start or end.
